            <p>  My name is Xolile Ntanzi, I am a student at code x academy. I am doing a one year course in Agile-web development.I am currently learning Javascript and a 
                bit of html and css. Being an Agile web developer is not only about coding. My role as an Agile-web developer is to estimate,plan and manage task, and report to clients about
                projects. Projects I've created so far is a basic web page using basic HTML and CSS and simple grid CSS, My second one was testing function using mocha and assert elements.
                This are some of the things I do as Agile web developer.....</p>
